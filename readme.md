# cgu

This python library consists of utility functions which are useful for parsing and writing c-style languages for code generation tools. Pythons string api, regex and dictionary make it a perfect language for parsing, contextualising and generating code.  

I have been recently developing a number of tools where code generation has been a very powerful tool to improve efficiency and reduce the need to manually write tiresome boiler-plate code. I ended up duplicating a lot of the functionality in this library so this project has started to become my go-to place for code gen needs.

So far I have been adding features as and when I need them, currently a subset of c/c++ is supported.
